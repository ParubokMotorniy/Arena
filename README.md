# Arenaâš”
A game mostly focused on a **combat system and basic ledge climbing mechanics**.

This creation stands out thanks to such mechanics and features:
- blending between different types of cameras (state-based, free-look, group...) 
- 3rd-person state-based generic combat system
- smooth animation playback&transitions 
- climbing system
- core AI mechanics
- ragdolls
- immersive scene
